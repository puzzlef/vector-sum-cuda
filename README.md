Performance of *sequential* vs *CUDA-based* **vector element max**.

This experiment was for comparing the performance between:
1. Find `max(x)` using a single thread (**sequential**).
2. Find `max(x)` accelerated using **CUDA** (*not power-of-2* reduce).
3. Find `max(x)` accelerated using **CUDA** (*power-of-2* reduce).

Here `x` is a 32-bit integer vector. Both approaches were attempted on a number
of vector sizes, running each approach 5 times per size to get a good time
measure. Note that time taken to copy data back and forth from the GPU is not
measured, and the sequential approach does not make use of *SIMD instructions*.
While it might seem that **CUDA** approach would be a clear winner, the results
indicate it is dependent upon the workload. Results indicate that **from 10^5**
**elements, CUDA approach performs better** than sequential. Both CUDA approaches
(*not power-of-2*/*power-of-2* reduce) seem to have similar performance.

All outputs are saved in a [gist] and a small part of the output is listed here.
Some [charts] are also included below, generated from [sheets]. This experiment
was done with guidance from [Prof. Kishore Kothapalli] and
[Prof. Dip Sankar Banerjee].
